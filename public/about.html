<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I was born in Vilnohirsk, Ukraine to a poor family in 1998. I graduated from Kherson University with a master's degree in 2020 as a prrimary school teacher.</p>

<p>I moved from Ukraine to the USA one and half years ago. I worked in my country as a primary school teacher, and also, as a shop assistant. I have been learning English since summer 2022, and I already completed my study at the Intensive English Program at the University of Miami. My next goal on my way to a new life is taking this course with the purpose of switching my major from primary school teacher to software engineer. Also, web development is very interesting not only because there are lots of opportunities but also because this develops a person's logical thinking skills.
