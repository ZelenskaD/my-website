<h1>Lack of Psychological Support as a Reason for an Unstable Society</h1>
<h2>Author: Daria Zelenska</h2>

<p>
    People are used to living in a society which does not have a balance in moral norms and values. Lack of professional psychological support as a reason for an unstable society in our time is a debated topic that is considered in many different ways. Humanity has divided opinions about psychology and psychologists as a major, and many people are prejudiced that this is unhelpful, and people who do not think they are mentally ill will not go to a therapist. Also, this part of people  are not thinking that if people who commit a crime, suicide or do violent action to people around, and also, people who were bullied by community, that they do not need help with mental health -  (because ) they did not feel lack of support by psychologists and other people. However, many agree that a major problem why people do spontaneous things such as a theft, murder, suicide, self-inflicted pain or express a violance to another mandatory is because they don’t have sessions with a therapist, but should. Moreover, they are convinced that even ordinary people must go to a psychologist at least once a month, and not only adults but also children from 6 years old.  According to The American Psychological Association (2014), more than 400 crimes committed by 143 wrongdoer with three major types of mental illness (disability) were studied and analyzed by scientists, who found that three percent of their lawlessness were related to their feelings of deep depression, four percent of them had a schizophrenia disorders, and ten percent  with bipolar disorder (para. 2).  This means that more than half the people around the world have mental issues, light or heavy, and many crimes were committed because of lack of support in childhood or teenager's age that, unfortunately, definitely lead to unstable society. There are some cases when people needed help from psychologists but did not get this, that led to catastrophic consequences such as: the existence of murders, thieves, alcohol and drugs addictions, domestic violence, bullying in society, suicide because of study, and an existance of serial killers. This paper will demonstrate how the inclusion of psychological support at school can reduce and prevent many of the issues mentioned previously.</p>

<h3>Problem of lack of psychological support</h3>
<p>
    The problem of lack of psychological support has existed for many decades. Many know that as our physical health - mental health needs support either because mental health can be under impact of many different factors, such as traumas, anxiety, bullying or abuse, violence from others, and many others. According to the Centers for Disease and Control (2021,as cited in Supporting Child and Student Social, Emotional, Behavioral, and Mental Help Needs, 2021): 
</p>
<ul>Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence 
    through adulthood… However, many children and students struggle with  mental 
    health challenges that impact their full access to and participation in learning and 
    result in behaviors inconsistent with school or program expectations ( p.4). 
</ul>
<p>As shown in a piece of research by Kelsey E. Engel  (2021), which examined 18-25 years old citizens of the U.S., 7.4% people of these groups have grave (serious) thinking about suicide, and 2.5% who are planing to commit this (p.9, para.2). Moreover, it is guaranteed to increase every year. Wilcox and his fellowships studied that lack of social support and highest depressive symptoms were associated with 8.7 times the danger (risk) of persistent suicidal risk in U.S. students in their first year of study (2010, as cited by Engel, 2021). This research has shown that many have thought about suicide, especially because of lack of support, which already led U.S. to have suicide as the 11th causes of death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). Despite this, people still look at people with mental problems, as dangerous and crazy people, because of stereotypes which were given by the media to us. However, many have other kinds of thinking that people with mental issues can be more often a victim of violent crime than the offender ( Ghiasi, Azhar and Singh, 2023). Both of the statements are correct in their own ways. Unfortunately, people who have a mental issue can even not know about it, some people can hide it, some people are shy, and some of them use their mental instability as an excuse to do violence to someone or commit a crime. 
</p>
<p>   As mentioned  by  Ali et al., “In 2018, nearly 3.5 million adolescents received mental health services in education settings” (2019, as cited in  Supporting Child and Student Social, Emotional, Behavioral, and Mental Help Needs, 2021). This means that more than 3.5 million people contacted support services for psychological and emotional help.  Moreover, Leeb et al. confirmed that the number of people who visited the emergency department due to mental health issues increased by 24% for 5–11-year-olds and 31% for 12–17-year-olds between January and October, 2020 (2020, as cited in Supporting Child and Student Social, Emotional, Behavioral, and Mental Help Needs, 2021).  In other words, if this problem still exists in the 21st century, when people have beliefs and values, and also a polite attitude to each other, every school must have mandatory classes with psychologists to keep the mental health of our society in balance. </p>

<h3>Low standard of living as a reason for unstable society</h3>
<p>The most prominent argument that  low-income living are not causing a criminal behavior is study of  “Childhood family income, adolescent violent criminality and substance misuse: quasi-experimental total population study” (2014),  that shows “there were no associations between childhood family income and subsequent violent criminality and substance misuse once we had adjusted for unobserved familial risk factors” (Sariaslan A. et. al, para. 5). Moreover, some studies show that if a person is from a low-income family, this does not definitely mean that he or she will commit a crime in the future or will have an addiction to something. This is definitely true.  However, taking into account many factors, such as living in poverty, high level of stress because of false hopes and wishes about financial instability, inability to travel and rest, and increasing of stress because of worrying how to get food, clothes, and where or how to get money to pay bills; moreover, existence of pressure from society because of low level of income that have huge impact on people to relieve their stress and pain with help of drugs and alcohol (Ginni Correa, April 17, 2023).  All of these lead to the question about whether people can prevent an increase in crime with psychological support or people. </p>
<p>Another study proved that “The relationship between addiction and poverty is complex. Addiction doesn’t discriminate, and poverty doesn’t necessarily cause addiction. However, lower-income people are more likely to struggle with drug and alcohol abuse” (Michael Bayba, March 14, 2023).  According to statistics by the U.S. Department of Justice (2014), “In 2008–12, the rate of violent victimization was highest for persons in poor households (39.8 per 1,000) and lowest for persons in high-income households (16.9 per 1,000)” (p.2).  This means that people living in poverty are more likely to commit burglary, larceny or theft. Also, a new research shows that kids who are growing up in poverty are seven times more likely to commit a crime or violence and be involved in violent crimes as young adults. This study mentions the importance of providing child-friendly public services, housing and education (Pearl L H Mok et. al., 2018).  These studies prove that it is necessary to include psychological support at school and that in its own way, can reduce risk of crimes from people with  low-income levels.

<h3>Victims or tyrants of domestic violence or bullying are not having mental issues?</h3>
<p>Another argument for not including psychological support at school, even if they are victims of bullying or domestic violence, is that:
    <ul>
        “They are not equipped with the time, resources, or training necessary to  give 
        students with signs of mental health issues the unique attention they  deserve. 
        Moreover, mental health education is seldom part of the student’s curriculum , 
        even though parents recognize the importance of the subject” (Mental health 
         in schools: How teachers can be the first line of support, n.d.).
   
    </ul>
    However, children with childhood traumas, depression, victims of bullying and domestic violence need immediate help with psychologists to overcome their mental issues and anxiety. If it will not be training classes or special classes with couple specialists as psychologists or psychiatrists as well, then it must be at least school psychologists who can help and support children; moreover, overcome or treat any mental issues.</p>
<p>On the other hand, children and students  can be not only victims but also a tyrant in cases of domestic violence. The existence of many cases of children-tyrants who feel superior because of the weakness of the victim shows that this is a way of self-assertion. As studies show by Karen Horney (1937, as cited by C. Nickerson, 2023), when a person needs some help or support from others but doesn't get it, he or she can feel lost or helpless, and as a result of it this person  “they try to fulfill their need for love and acceptance through four “neurotic trends””: affection, submissiveness, power, or withdrawal (subtitle Theories of neurotic needs, para.4).  According to his theory of neurosis (1940, as cited by B.Glatt, 2002), which is definitely a mental issue, the manic-depressive syndrome, the borderline personality, and some of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) typologies (p.3, para. 2). A decision that one can make to look at these studies is that victims of bullying or domestic violence can be not only victims but also tyrants that must definitely have shown since childhood, and that can be treated with psychological support at school. </p>

<h3> Lack of supporting program for students as a cause for student’s suicide</h3>
<p>One more argument for the including of psychological therapy and treatment at school is that because of challenging programs of education the increasing of suicidal thoughts and suicidal commits are observed by many especially in high schools, colleges and universities. As many know, a great quality of education requires hard work, highest involvement in learning, and strong abilities to overcome stress and tiredness. Unfortunately, many studies that survey the academic success of students at many different universities show that 16% of students were recently diagnosed with depression. Moreover, more than 90%  of people who already commited suicide had mental disorders or addiction to drugs as it was found ( Governors State University in Chicago’s Southland, n.d.).  How statistic by National Survey on Drug Use and Health   (2016, as cited by University of Michigan, n.d.) shows that “4.0% of the adult U.S. population reported having suicidal thoughts in the past year. 8.8% of those 18-25 year old seriously considered suicide, 2.9% of those 18-25 year old made a plan, and 1.8% of 18-25 year olds attempted”. Also, as study by Katrin Park (2021) shows, as another example of suicide because of study as a reason of lack psychological support, that for the last two decades South Korea has a highest suicide rank in the midst of developed countries in the world; moreover, South Korea has a ratio of 24,6 people for every 100,000 who committed suicides, compared to 14, 5 deaths because of suicide in the United States  in 2017 (para. 3). Besides, as a reason to include psychological support in the school program people can learn from Finland which has cut the number of growing risk and commits of suicide by half since 1990 with government helping to boost treatment and support for people (K. Park, 2021) . </p>

<h3>Existence of criminals, as a serial killers, as a way to show holes in medical system</h3>
<p>The last argument to provide psychological support in educational institutions is that this novelty can reduce the emergence of serial  killers, or at least this can help us to notice mental problems with health earlier and prepare everything to eliminate harmful impact on the person who has this problem and community as well. The topic about serial killers and terrorists is actually due to the last decades and many see this as a trace of psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, etc.  According to a study by National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (2005):
<ul>
    The development of a serial killer involves a combination of these factors                    
      (biological, social, and psychological in nature), which exist together in a rare         
     confluence in certain individuals. They have the appropriate biological predisposition, 
     molded by their psychological makeup, which is present at a critical time in their    
     social development (chapter III, para. 8-9).
</ul>
This study also shows that all of serial killers have common traits  such as “sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or guilt, impulsivity, the need for control, and predatory behavior”, that lead to the conclusion that this people has disorder that impacted on their mental health, so serial killers might want to feel a power advantage over the weak in order to assert themselves. When people will know about the existence of mental health problems, and they will have psychological support if they found one problem from themselves, it definitely will help to prevent the increase of serial murders and their offers as well. 
</p>
<hr/>
<p>In short, the problem of lack of psychological support will definitely still continue for many decades after, and this topic will continue to be discussed. However, if people will not be able to get help and support from professional, and community as well, than humanity has potential risk to extremely grow unstable society and continue to exist of thieves, alcohol and drugs addictions, domestic violence, bullying in society, suicide because of study, and serial killers. Moreover, it is definitely solution to reduce risk of mental illness people to go that way that already choose Finland. This problem must be solved because not only people with mental illness get harmful effects (destruction) and who potentially can be dangerous to society,  but also every person around.
